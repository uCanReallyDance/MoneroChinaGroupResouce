00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,540
That's 10 to the 77th.
那就是10^77。

153
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,780
That's how vast the space is of the random number that you're choosing

162
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,880
The aggregate level of scarcity, that is,
从稀缺程度上来说，

163
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,180
how do we know how much of the Bitcoin there is in the entire monetary system?

164
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,240
and how do we know that's not going to get corrupted?
我们怎么知道不会被破坏（增发/丢失）？

165
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,180
Well, the scarcity is

166
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,720
enforced by an open network of miners

169
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,140
Finally, how do we know that the record of

171
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,600
which is, what the blockchain records.
这就是根据区块链所记录的内容，

172
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,660
The blockchain is a series of blocks.
区块链是一系列的块组成的链式数据结构。

173
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,880
Each block contains transactions from

178
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,620
Because, as we all know, there's bit rot.
因为，比特衰减。

179
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,780
There can be corruption,

180
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,580
there could be some
可能有一些，

181
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,800
malfeasance going on with the state of the database.
数据库状态持续不正常。

182
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,120
The database is maintained because each block
区块链数据库由多个块构成，

183
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,720
has a small data field in it that the miner can change
里面有一个小的数据字段，矿工可以更改，

184
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,200
that's called the nonce.
那就是随机数。

185
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
And each miner，
每个矿工，

186

randomly changes the nonce so that the hash of the block is lower than a number,
随机更改随机数，以使块的哈希值小于这个数字，

187
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,420
called the difficulty.
叫做难度。

188
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,480
Usually when we talk about hash functions
通常当我们谈论哈希函数时，

189
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,680
we don't care about the actual value of the hash function.
我们不在乎哈希函数的实际值。

190
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,820
We just care that the hash matches some other hash.
我们只关心哈希与其他哈希是否匹配。

191
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,200
Like if you're checking for file integrity,
就像你要检查文件的完整性一样，

192
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,360
then you would take the hash of the file that you downloaded
那么你将对下载文件进行hash

193
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,080
and compare that with the hash of the file that you're looking for
然后将其与您要查找的文件的哈希值进行比较

194
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,820
and you compare those.
然后比较一下。

195
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,160
In this case, we're actually caring about the number of the hash.
在这种情况下，我们实际上关心的是哈希数。

196
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,320
How small, how large is that number
这个数字有多小，多大

197
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:53,080
and the difficulty is a number that must be
而困难则是一个数使得

198
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,800
satisfied by each block.
每个块都适合。

199
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,380
In other words,
换一种说法，

200
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,520
the hash of each block needs to be lower than the difficulty.
每个区块的哈希值必须低于难度。

201
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,460
To make a real world analogy of this,
为了真实地类比，

202
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,100
imagine that you have (an) accounting book

00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,920
You want to make a way to make sure that
你想要一种方法来确保

205
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,380
each page is really rare in some way.
每个页面在某种程度上确实很稀有。

206
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,080
One way you could do this is you could say
你可以这样

207
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:26,800
the mass of every page of this accounting book has to be an even multiple of 1 million atoms.
该会计账簿每一页的质量必须是100万个原子的偶数倍。

208
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,240
Each accountant is going to be
每个会计师都将，

209
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,920
kind of touching the paper,
碰这个纸，

210
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,020
rubbing it, erasing little bits
摩擦纸，擦一点，

211
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,000
because at that level you're taking away or adding

212
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,700
trillions and trillions of atoms
数万亿个原子，

213
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,140
so it's going to be a random number whether

214
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,340
your page is actually a exact multiple of a million atoms.
您的纸实际上是一百万个原子的精确倍数，

215
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,500
Once that's found,
一旦找到，

216
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,480
that's a very rare page.
那是非常罕见的纸。

217
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,860
It's a rare page because it has an
这是一个罕见的纸，因为它有一个，

218
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,820
exact multiple of 1 million atoms to it
一百万个原子的精确倍数。

219

220
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,540
you can copy that exactly.
你可以完全复制这个纸。

221
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,300
Now you have a chain of blocks,
现在您有了一堆块，

222
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,200
each one of these has this rare attribute
每一个块都具有这种罕见的属性

223
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,760
and the blockchain links them all together.
区块链将它们链接在一起。

224
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,680
Scarcity in Bitcoin and Monero
比特币和门罗币的稀缺性

225
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
they both have an original code base.
他们都有原始的代码库（门罗不是比特的分叉也不是其他的分叉）。

226
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,640
There are many, many projects in cryptocurrency in which
加密货币项目有很多很多，

227
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,540
Bitcoin was simply forked and modified a little bit,
很多只是简单地分叉比特币和修改了一点参数，

228
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,800
(but) that's not the case in Monero.
但是，门罗币的情况并非如此。

229
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,060
It was written from scratch.
它是从头开始写的。

230
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,380
The elliptic curves used are different;
使用的椭圆曲线是不同的。

231
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,800
this is a form of technical hedging.
这是技术对冲的一种形式。

232
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,600
In Bitcoin the secp256k1 elliptical curve is used
在比特币中，使用secp256k1椭圆曲线，

233
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,860
whereas in Monero it's ed25519.
而在门罗币中则是ed25519。

234
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,140
Both Bitcoin and Monero, as I mentioned before, require a private key.
正如我之前提到的，比特币和门罗币都需要私钥。

235
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,720
Spending the cryptocurrency requires that you know a number
发送加密货币需要你知道一个数字，

236
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,160
and that's the private key.
那就是私钥。

237
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,620
That's true in both Bitcoin and Monero.
比特币和门罗币都是如此。

238
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,420
Where we start to differ is that
有所不同的是

239
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,060
Monero also has what's called a view key.
门罗币还具有所谓的查看私钥。

240
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,340
The view key is another private key
查看私钥是另一个私钥

241
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,500
which is actually as kind of a subset of the spend key.
实际上，查看私钥功能是发送私钥的子集。

242
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,640
The view key is what is needed to decrypt
查看密钥是用来解密的，

243
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,600
the transactions on the blockchain that you personally are involved with.
解密区块链上和你相关的交易。

244
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,740
If you have the view key
如果你有查看私钥，

245
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,440
you can see what transactions you were involved in on the blockchain.

246
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,160
Everything else remains encrypted.
而其他人的内容均保持加密状态。

247
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,900
The address spaces is different,
地址空间也不同，

248
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,300
in Bitcoin it's 10 to the 60th, in Monero it's 10 to the 76th.
在比特币中是10^60，而在门罗币中是10^76。

249
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,080
There are more addresses available in Monero,
门罗币的可用地址更多（此外门罗还有子地址功能，可以每次使用不同的接收地址来提升隐私性），

250
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,740
which means if you're worried about the birthday problem
这意味着如果你担心（不用担心） “生日问题”

251
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,140
the birthday problem is the problem in which
生日的问题是什么呢？

252
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,140
if you have a group of 30 people,
如果你有一个30人的团体，

253
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,800
chances are much higher than you would expect that 2 people out of those 30 have the same birthday.
30人中的2个人，生日相同的几率要比你想像的高得多

254
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,380
If you extend this now to the problem of picking a random number
如果将其扩展到选择随机数做账户的问题
255
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,400
and calling it your own for
（随机选个数字）把这个账户作为自己的

256
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,840
a cryptocurrency account, you have the same problem.
一个加密货币帐户，你面临着同样的问题。

257
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,520
There's no guarantee that
没有人能保证，

258
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,700
the random number that you picked for your cryptocurrency account
你生成的私钥

259
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,860
is not going to subsequently be picked by me.
不会被别人使用，

260
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,660
That's the birthday problem and
这就是生日的问题，

261
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,080
the birthday problem is less of a concern the more addresses there are.
地址越多相同私钥的可能性越小。

262
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,720
The emission deceleration is another difference between Bitcoin and Monero.
供应量减少的速度是比特币和门罗币之间的另一个区别，

263
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,400
In Bitcoin it's step-wise.
在比特币中，（供应减少量）是跳跃的，（大家一般称为减半）。

264
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,680
You might have heard of this thing called "the halvening".
您可能听说过这种叫做“减半”的事情。

265
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,600
This is: every 4 years, in Bitcoin,
每四年，比特币，

266
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,900
the number of Bitcoins that gets rewarded to miners
奖励给矿工的数量，

267
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,720
as a reward for finding a page in the blockchain gets cut in half.
都会较之前减少一半。

268
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,000
Which means that on every miners calendar
这意味着在每个矿工的日历上，

269
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,260
there's a date circled in red that
有一个用红色圈起来的日期，

270
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,700
their income is going to get cut in half.
他们的挖矿收入将减少一半（可以理解为减薪，在付出同样工作量的情况下薪水减半，为了收入需要更加努力）。

271
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,360
And that introduces a bunch of
这其实引入了

272
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,760
needless drama, really, in mining.
不必要的东西。

273
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,760
In Monero, we avoid this by having a continuously decreasing emission.
在门罗币中，我们通过不断减少排放来避免这种情况，（可以理解为慢慢减少奖励，每一天都在缓慢减少）。

274
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,600
Now another difference is in
现在另一个区别是，

275
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,140
what is the emission rate of coins in the far future.
在不久的将来，币的增发率是多少？

276
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,340
In Bitcoin, the block reward eventually goes to zero
在比特币中，区块奖励最终变为零，

277
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:10,600
and they anticipate using transaction fees to make up the difference.
他们期望使用交易费用来弥补差额，（即用80比特币每日奖励来弥补1800比特币每日奖励，2020年4月数据）

278
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,700
In Monero, there we have a concern that we want to always be assured that
在门罗币，我们有顾虑所以要确保

279
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,060
miners will have incentive to keep working for the system.
矿工将有动力继续为该系统工作。

280
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,760
And (in) Monero we have what's called a tail emission
门罗币将有尾部的供应，

281
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,860
which works out to be 0.6 Monero per block
每个区块0.6个门罗币的奖励，

282
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,700
that goes on in perpetuity.
永远持续下去。

283
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,500
But that future money basically gets used to pay miners
未来的钱用于向矿工支付，

284
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,840
to continue to provide security for the network.
继续为网络提供安全性。

285
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,600
What's the far future inflation rate then?
那么远期的通货膨胀率是多少？

286
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,020
In Bitcoin, they can say it's exactly zero.
在比特币中，可以说它完全为零，

287
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,960
In Bitcoin they're fond of saying there's only ever going to be 21 million Bitcoins created
系统只会创造2100万个比特币，

288
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,700
and that's an easy thing for people to understand.
这是人们容易理解的事情。

289
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,300
But in Monero, we have constant linear inflation
但是在门罗币中，有恒定的线性通货膨胀

290
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,880
but it's not really correct to say that this is "infinite supply" as
不完全是“无限供应”

291
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,400
that's what gets bandied about.
这是门罗被谣言中伤的日常

292
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,420
Because if you look at the inflation rate, in Monero,
因为如果你查看门罗的通货膨胀率，

293
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,240
it asymptotically goes to zero.
它渐近地趋于零。

294
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,920
If you look at any macroeconomic theory,
如果你看过任何宏观经济学的理论，

295
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,820
what the relevant variable is
相关变量

296
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,740
is the inflation rate.
就是通货膨胀率。

297
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,460
Nobody really cares that
没有人真的在乎，

298
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,560
the nominal amount of US dollars is going up by whatever trillions of dollars per year.
美元每年增发数万亿美元。

299
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
It's the percentage that matters
但重要的是百分比，

300
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,220
and in Monero that percentage is already low and
门罗币，这个增发率已经很低了（目前低于比特币和未来一段时间2040都要低于比特币）

301
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,460
it'll continue getting lower.
它会继续降低。

302
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,140
Some curves to show what I'm talking about
曲线显示了我所说的

303
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,180
These are supply emission curves showing
这些是供应排放曲线，

304
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,460
how many coins of each type exist as a function of time.
每种类型存在多少币相对时间的函数。

305
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,720
You can see that Monero had a later start here
看到门罗币从这里开始

306
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,620
and it has a tail emission.
它有尾部供应。

307
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,960
This tail emission is this constant linear slope.
该尾部供应是线性的。

308
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,620
The reason for this slope, again, is that
线性的原因呢，

309
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:57,380
the new coins that get emitted are being rewarded to miners who helped secure the network.
是为了激励矿工能够长久的维持网络的运行和安全性。

310
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,220
Whereas in Bitcoin, they have an impending problem to deal with.
而在比特币中，有一个迫在眉睫的问题需要处理。

311
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,500
And that their coin emission is coming up to this 21 million mark,
发行到达2100万之后，

312
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,220
it's going to go basically to zero.
增发将为0。

313
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,240
Then there are some papers out there that have
有一些论文指出，

314
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,320
proposed that the security of the network might be in jeopardy at that point.
那时网络的安全性会遭到冲击。

315
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,100
What if we take the first derivative of this curve
如果我们采用该曲线的一阶导数

316
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:24,580
so, we look at how much more supply is there in this year versus last year.
因此，我们看今年与去年相比有多少供应。

317
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,380
In other words, what's the inflation rate?
换句话说，通货膨胀率是多少？

318
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,700
Here's what you see.
这就是你所看到的。

319
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,060
I'm comparing several different assets here.
我在这里比较几种不同的资产。

320
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,060
This is the inflation rate of gold.
这是黄金的通货膨胀率。

321
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,620
We usually don't think of gold is inflating
我们通常不认为黄金会膨胀，

322
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,440
but of course there are miners
但是，

323
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,700
there are actual physical miners digging in the ground and
当然有实际的矿工在地下挖矿，

324
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,940
coming up with gold chunks to add to the world's supply of above-ground gold.
挖出金块以增加世界上地上黄金的供应。

325
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,160
That turns out to be about 1.5% per year of inflation in gold.
结果导致每年黄金通胀是1.5％。

326
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,840
So if you think of gold as being sound money
因此，如果你认为黄金是可靠的货币，

327
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:01,500
then that 1.5% inflation rate is going to be sort of a line in the sand.
那么1.5％的通货膨胀率简直是毛毛雨啦。

328
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,300
As you can see - both Bitcoin and Monero
如你所见，

329
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,160
this dotted blue line is showing where we are right now.
蓝点虚线显示了我们现在的位置。

330
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,280
We're coming to a very interesting point in cryptocurrency history
我们正在进入加密货币历史中非常有趣的（时间）点

331
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,880
in that, up until now
到现在为止

332
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,360
there's been a lot of emission happening.
已经发行了很多（加密货币），

333
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,080
In order to get these coins out there
在那里，

334
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,320
the block rewards have been relatively high
区块奖励相对较高，

335
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,680
but we're now coming up on a new kind of era of scarcity
但我们现在正进入一种新的稀缺时期，

336
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,600
if you look at this to the right of here.
看这里右边，

337
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,400
And in fact, the inflation rate of Monero is going to be lower than that of Bitcoin
实际上，门罗币的通货膨胀率将低于比特币

338
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,380
for the next 6 years, until 2025.
接下来的6年，直到2025年。

339
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,540
Then there's going to be a 4 year period when they're about the same
之后的四年两者保持一致，

340
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,800
and then, starting in 2029, the
从2029年开始，

341
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,160
inflation rate of Bitcoin will once again go below Monero.
比特币的通货膨胀率将再次低于门罗币。

342
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,320
But then, again, this comes at with a question mark:
但是，这又带有一个问号？

343
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,520
how are those miners going to be paid, to be incentivized to support the network?
那些矿工将如何获得报酬，以激励他们支持网络？

344
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,920
Since that is a crucial feature of Nakamoto consensus,
由于这是中本聪共识的重要特征，

345
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,580
that game theoretically, all of the miners are incentivized to be honest
从理论上讲，所有矿工都需要受到激励，

346
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,700
and not to try to game the system for their own greed.
而不是为了自己的贪婪而继续游戏系统。

347
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,320
There's a form of unwanted scarcity and that's mining hardware.
此外，有一种形式的不必要的稀缺，那就是挖矿硬件。

348
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,620
And this is something that has been a big issue in Monero.
在门罗币中，这一直是一个大问题。

349
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,240
In the Bitcoin white paper, Nakamoto wrote "one CPU, one vote"
中本聪在比特币白皮书中写道：“一个CPU代表着一个投票权”

350
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,800
and that idea is that the reward that a miner gets
这是矿工获得的报酬的依据，也就是工作量证明

351
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,540
should be proportional to their effort.
奖励应该与他们的努力成正比。

352
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,880
It should be proportional to the expense
应该与费用成比例，

353
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,780
that the miner incurred in mining.
这是矿工在采矿中发生的。

354
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,040
In other words, there should ideally be a linear function
换句话说，理想情况下在矿工费用和矿工报酬之间，

355
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,520
between the miners expense and the miners reward.
是呈线性关系的。

356
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,560
Now, unfortunately, economies of scale in silicon manufacturing
现在，不幸的是，集成电路制造的规模经济，

357
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,580
have destroyed this linear relationship.
破坏了这种线性关系，

358
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,500
In other words, if you have about 25 million dollars
换句话说，如果您有大约2500万美元

359
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,360
to spend on a new fabrication facility in Shenzhen,
花费在深圳的新制造工厂，

360
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,980
then you can turn out your own silicon chips that do nothing but
然后您可以只用来制造自己的硅芯片，

361
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,000
do the Bitcoin proof-of-work.
做比特币的工作量证明。

362
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,820
These are ASICS, and
这些芯片被称为 ASICS，（专门针对某种运算特别制作的芯片，没有其他用处，也不是先进科技）

363
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,560
they've been on the network, on Bitcoin for several years now,
他们已经在网络上挖了很多年比特币了，

364
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:20,180
to the point that at this point Bitcoin mining is basically a cns oligopoly.
至此，比特币的开采基本上就是中国的寡头垄断。

365
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,520
This brings up centralization concern.
这引起了人们对集中化的关心。

366
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,020
It's not necessarily a problem that it's cn that has all the mining.
挖矿集中化当然是个问题，

367
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,080
It's really more of a problem that
这实际上是一个更大的问题

368
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,720
it's one certain area of the world that has
这是世界上某个地方拥有

369
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,720
basically control of all of the world's Bitcoin hash power.
基本上控制着世界上所有比特币的哈希能力。

370
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,900
There are further news items that are cause for concern,
还有更进一步的消息值得关注，

371
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,640
for example, the growing trade war bewtween China and West.
例如，中国和西方世界愈演愈烈的贸易战。

372
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,100
There is a press article out that said
有一篇新闻是这样说的

373
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,060
the Chinese government has recently decreed that
中国政府最近颁布法令

374
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,080
only Chinese computer hardware is to be uesd in government offices
在一年内，中国政府办公室里只能使用

375
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,740
starting in like a year.
中国制造的电脑硬件

376
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,820
There's some deadline by which of the dells and
在某个截至日期前美国戴尔公司和其它

377
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,820
American companies' computers are to be kicked out,
美国公司的计算机将被踢出其市场，

378
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:12,200
so something similar could well happen for manufactured Bitcoin ASICS.
因此，比特币ASICS矿机可能会发生类似的情况。

379
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,400
We kind of take for granted that there's a free flow of goods in the world
我们认为世界上货物自由流通是理所当然的

380
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,800
but what happens if not only does one part of the world control the manufacture
但是,如果只有一家工厂垄断了制造会怎样

381
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,860
of all of the crypto hash power
也就是所有的算力

382
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,200
but then is unable to even export it due to a trade war.
矿机甚至无法出口。

383
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,200
In Monero we tried to take this decentralization question quite seriously
门罗对待这个问题严肃审慎，

384
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,820
and we've done some changes to the proof-of-work

385
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,320
to support the little guy who's mining.
支持挖矿的小朋友们。

386
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,800
That is, when Bitcoin started
也就是说，当比特币开始时，

387
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,680
it was possible for just a regular person running
一个普通人挖比特币是可能的，

388
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,840
the Bitcoin client on their computer to actually have a shot
他们计算机上的比特币客户端实际上是有机会的，

389
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,900
at getting a mining reward.
去得到一些采矿奖励。

390
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,960
Those days are long gone because now
那些日子早已一去不复返了，因为现在，

391
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,940
the hash power is dominated by these massive farms of ASICS.
哈希率主要由ASICS的这些大型矿场掌握。

392
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,660
It's just hopeless for any little guy to try to mine Bitcoin.
任何小家伙都无法尝试开采比特币。

393
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,880
In Monero, we're trying to change that
门罗币正在尝试改变这一点，

394
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,220
and the proof of work has been modified several times.
并且工作量证明算法已多次修改。

395
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,860
Now, as of just last month,
现在，截至上个月，

396
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,160
the proof of work in Monero is now RandomX
Monero的工作量证明算法是 RandomX，

397
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,060
which actually uses every single capability of a CPU
实际上使用了CPU的所有指令集

398
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,920
in doing the proof of work.
在工作量证明的过程中，

399
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,600
There's a basically a random program that gets executed.
有一个随机程序可以执行。

400
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,680
Each core of the processor needs 2 gigabytes of RAM to run well.
处理器的每个核心需要2GB的RAM才能正常运行。

401
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,280
This was a design decision made to
这是个设计是为了

402
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,080
make it harder for botnets to control the network,
使僵尸网络更难以控制网络，（也就是少数黑客很难控制大量普通用户电脑进行对网络的控制）

403
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,460
because if your computer is infected with a botnet
因为如果您的计算机感染了僵尸网络，

404
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,180
and 14 out of your 16 gigabytes of RAM are being eaten up,

405
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,320
you're probably going to notice it.

406
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,260
It was deliberate that design decision in RandomX to use a

407
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:00,940
high required amount of RAM for processing.
计算所需大量内存。

408
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,020
There's another source of scarcity
还有另一个稀缺性来源，

00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,020
that is not necessarily one that you want in a blockchain,
不一定是您想要在区块链中使用的那个，

410
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,200
and that is access to layer one.
那就是通过第一曾网络，也就是主网。

411
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,560
Bitcoin's 1 megabyte block limit caused a project fork.
比特币的1兆字节的区块大小限制导致了项目分叉，（比特币社区分裂，目前三个币都声称自己是比特币）

412
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,500
There was basically a civil war in Bitcoin over whether or not it was okay
使得比特币还存在一场内战，

413
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,480
to make blocks stay at this 1 megabyte limit.
为了使块大小保持1MB的限制，

414
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,820
It still rages on to this day. It's still a holy war
这仍然是一场圣战。

415
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,060
and this is something that Monero has avoided thus far.
这是迄今为止Monero要避免的事情。

416
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,460
Its solution to this is to use a adaptive block size
它的解决方案是使用自适应块大小

417
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:38,380
in which the maximum block size of a Monero block is flexible
其中Monero块的最大块大小是灵活的，可以变大也可以变小

418
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,540
and it can organically expand or shrink along with demand.
可以随着交易需求进行有机扩展或缩小。

419
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,060
With, of course, provisions in there
当然，其中有一些规则，

420
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,620
to prevent the system from getting gamed.
以防止系统被攻击（例如某分山对比特币进行了碎片交易攻击）

421
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,500
And there's ongoing research to reduce the transaction size.
并且门罗研究院也在进行减小交易规模的研究。

422
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,280

Basically, this metadata just kind of

continues to gather on this blockchain until you have a situation

which is actually much worse than in Fiat.

first came into being as a reward that went to a miner.

Once the miner gets that Bitcoin and then they spend it, it starts circulating in the Bitcoin economy.
一旦矿工获得了比特币，然后他们花了它，它就会开始在比特币经济中流通。

500
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,780
But because the blockchain is transparent, it's totally "see-through".
但是因为区块链是透明的，所以它完全是“透明的”。

00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,740
The entire history of every single Bitcoin now in existence can be traced back

503
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,620
It's as if you have a 10 euro banknote
就好像您有一张10欧元的钞票

504
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,620
and on the back of that 10 euro banknote you see a nice list showing

507
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,400
How about innocent people getting falsely accused

and that is what is profoundly disturbing about having this.

513
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,640
And I call it a surveillance coin.
我称比特币为监视币。

514
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,460
In a surveillance coin, it's not just value that transmits

515
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,620

519
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,860
In contrast, Monero is fungible.
相反，门罗币是可互换的。

520
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,020
Fungible just means that every unit of currency is
可互换货币意味着每个货币单位都是1:1的

521
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,860
indistinguishable from the other units.
与其他单位没有区别。

522
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,980
If I have 10 Monero, you have 10 Monero and then
如果我有10个门罗币，那么你有10个门罗币

523
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,840
we both trade the 10 Monero to other people, they still look like the 10 Monero.
我们都将10M个门罗币交易给其他人，他们看起来仍然像10个门罗币。

One is ring signatures.

00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,740
In ring signatures,
在环签名中，

530

the sender of funds is lined up along with 10 other senders of funds
资金发送者与其他10个资金发送者混在一起

531
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:40,040
and the only thing that you know happened in that transaction is one out of those 11 people sent money.
而且您知道该交易中发生的唯一一件事是，这11个人有一个人发送了钱。

532
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,440
It's as if every time you spend money,

now you have 10 friends or 10 random people, 10 decoys
现在您的10个朋友或10个随机人，10个诱饵（帮你打掩护）

534
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,620
and all that you know, cryptographically, is one of the 11 have sent the money.
从密码上来说，您所知道的就是这11个汇款中的一个。

535
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,860
That protects the sender's identity.
这样可以保护发送者的身份。

536
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,520
How about the receivers identity?
其次接收者的身份如何？

537
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,640
Well, the receiver's Monero account does not appear unencrypted on the Monero blockchain.
接收者的门罗币帐户同样不是透明的。

538
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,760
A one-time-use address is what gets put on the blockchain
一次性地址是放在区块链上的内容

539
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,680
so that protects the recipients' privacy.
从而保护收件人的隐私。

540
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,720
How about the amount that gets sent? Because there are

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,580
attacks that can be done by knowing,

kind of observing your pattern of how much you spend.

543
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,860
That is covered with technology, RingCT,

544
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:29,240
which originally was developed for Bitcoin but actually first got implemented in Monero.

545
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,180
RingCT stands for confidential transactions.
RingCT代表机密交易。

546
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,920
And all these things (are) combined to make Monero's fungibility.
所有这些东西加在一起，使门罗币具有可互换性。

547
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,600
The end result is that in Monero,
最终结果是在Monero中，

548
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,600
coins are indistinguishable from their another or they have no memory.

They have no memory of where they've been,
它们不记得自己去过的地方

550
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,100
which is really what you want in a money because the opposite,
这确实是你想要的钱,相反的话

551
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,060
if you have money that has perfect memory, like it is in Bitcoin,
你难道更喜欢带记忆的钱吗，就像比特币这种

552
00:31:54,060 --> 00:32:02,540
that unfortunately gets used to falsely associate activities of people who had nothing to do with each other.
总是不幸的错误地将彼此无关的人的活动与他人联系起来。

553
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:08,300
Because Monero is fungible, users benefit by having privacy.
由于门罗币是可互换的，因此用户可以从拥有隐私中受益。

554
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,120
The Monero blockchain is public just like Bitcoin.

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,240
All you have to do is download the Monero software and you too

然后拥有门罗区块链的副本，其中包含谁向谁发送了什么的完整历史记录。

559

the details of this blockchain are encrypted

561

You cannot do what you can do in Bitcoin which is

and for them this kind of feature is a showstopper.
对他们来说，这种功能是风靡一时的。

566

this invitation to be creepy on your neighbor

575
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,220
is something that is intrinsically part of Bitcoin.

576
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,780
And the deeper (it) gets into society,

00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,640
the more insidious it is,

the more of a threat it is to all of our privacy.

sounds like only the criminals are going to want to use it".

582
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:00,280
It is a slander I'm kind of tired of hearing.
这种诽谤，我都听烦了。

583
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,060
Monero benefits people who have nothing to hide.

584
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,720
The chief benefit is that

589
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:26,400
you are accepting the risk that somebody unsavory will be sending you something.
您正在接受某些风险，那就是有些不讨人喜欢的人会向您发送东西。

590
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,800
For example, let's say you have a business you sell stickers or

获得了一个T恤的订单。

您不知道他们是毒贩，他们只是向您发送一些比特币要买东西，因为您是T恤销售商，你只是卖东西收钱

you need to get money from people.

598
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:59,280
But because the people watching the blockchain and putting faces and names

599
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,320

they can try to program that in

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,740
is this bad person really related to you.
这个坏人真的和你有关系。（因为你跟黑帮，毒贩有资金往来）

603
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:16,020
The only way that somebody finds out that they've been bitten by this is that
收款人大多时候不觉得有事，直到这种侥幸维持的平静被打破

604
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:21,200
"oh, geez, Coinbase just emailed me and my account's been closed."
“哦，天哪，交易所刚给我发了电子邮件，我的帐户已被关闭。”

609
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,940
It's just that the money itself has this

fatal flaw of being totally, (of) having a history behind it.

611
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,980
It's not really money,

612
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,320
it's like beanie babies, it's like collectables.
这就像豆豆公仔（类似于芭比娃娃），就像收藏品。

613
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,160
It's like collectible items with their own serial number that are getting passed around in this economy,

I want to leave with a Nobel Prize winning idea.

I find that not too many people have heard of this paper.
我发现没有多少人听说过这篇论文。

617
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:10,400
George Akerlof won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on asymmetric information in markets.
乔治·阿克洛夫（George Akerlof）因其在市场中的非对称信息方面的工作而获得了诺贝尔经济学奖。

618
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,520
Anyone here know this paper well?
这里有人对这篇文章很了解吗？

619
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,540
Okay. Great.
好的，赞。

620
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,060
I'll explain it briefly.
我将简要说明。

621
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,540
There are two kinds of used cars.
有两种二手车。

622
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,540
There are lemons, which are the bad used cars.
一种车我们叫它柠檬，代表坏的二手车。

623
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,720
Those are... you buy them and then they break immediately - those are lemons.
那些是...您购买它们，然后它们立即坏掉-那些破车俚语里就叫柠檬。

624
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,380
The other kind of used car is a peach - these are the good cars.
另一种二手车是桃子-桃子代表是好车。

625
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,360
Those owners of the peaches, they did all the maintenance.
那些桃子的主人，他们做了所有的维护工作。

626
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,720
They change the oil, they did all the work to make sure that they have a nice car to sell.
他们更换机油，并做了所有工作以确保有一辆好车要出售。

627
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,700
Sellers know whether they're selling a lemon or a peach.
卖家知道他们在卖柠檬车还是桃子车。

628
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,020
The seller knows that. If you're selling a lemon, you know it.
卖方知道这一点。如果你卖破车，你怎么可能不知道。

629
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,580
And you're just trying to make money off the selling of the lemon.
而且卖家只是想通过卖柠檬破车来赚钱。

630
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,740
If you have a peach, you know it because you've been doing maintenance on that car.
如果你卖桃子车，那你也就知道了，因为您一直在对该车进行保养。

631
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,100
However, the buyer of the car is ignorant
但是，汽车的买主却一无所知

632
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:08,620
because both lemon sellers and peach sellers make extra sure that the paint job on the car is extra shiny.
因为柠檬销售商和桃子销售商都会确保汽车上的油漆特别有光泽（表面工作）。

633
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,740
The cars all look alike to the buyer
这些车对买家来说看起来都一样

634
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,120
so the buyer knows that they are vulnerable in this situation.
因此买方知道在这种情况下他们处于弱势。

635
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,160
The buyer knows that they could end up with a lemon.
买家知道他们最终可能会得到柠檬。

636
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,420
Because the buyer is ignorant but not totally ignorant.
因为买方是无知的，但不是傻子。

637
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,920
They are actually aware of their own ignorance.
他们实际上意识到自己的无知。

638
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:34,200
(And) because of that, the buyer then adjusts their offer price to be slightly lower than that of a peach.
因此，买方随后将其报价调整为略低于桃子的报价。

639
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,820
The asking, offer price for the car is going to be not quite at the peach price here.
这辆车的报价将不完全符合桃子的价格。

640
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,600
It's going to be slightly lower.
它将略低。

641
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,380
What happens then?
那会发生什么呢？

642
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:50,500
If you're selling a lemon and you see this pretty high price being offered for cars, you're happy.
如果您在卖柠檬，而看到汽车的报格很高，那您会很高兴。

643
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:56,880
Because your lemon, which is worth this low price, can sell for this.
因为您的柠檬值得这个低价，因此可以出售。

644
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,900
So the lemon sellers are happy.
所以柠檬卖主很高兴。

645
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,000
There are more suckers out there to buy their lemons.
还会吸引更多人买他们的柠檬破车。

646
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,040
How about the peach sellers? The peach sellers are the ones who did the work to have a good car to sell
桃子卖家呢？卖桃子的人是那些努力卖出好车的人

647
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,400
and now they're seeing this offer price which is less than the peach price.
现在他们看到这个报价比桃子的成本价格还低。

648
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,380
They're discouraged and slightly offended
他们很气馁，觉得被冒犯了

649
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,740
because all that work they did, all the good work that they did to keep that car good.
因为他们所做了所有工作，以及为保持车良好所做的所有出色工作。

650
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,680
And they followed all the rules with their car.
他们对待他们的车一直是循规蹈矩的

651
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:31,840
That good behavior is not getting rewarded in the form of a high price coming from the buyer.
良好行为并不会以买方高价获得回报。

652
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,860
So the peach sellers get discouraged, they leave the market.
因此，桃子销售商感到灰心，他们离开了市场。

653
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,080
What happens is that peach sellers leave.
在桃子卖家离开后

654
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,720
Well, now the buyers figure out that
好吧，现在买家知道

655
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,600
their chance of buying a lemon has just gone up
他们买柠檬的机会增加了

656
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,020
and the price that they're going to offer goes down.
他们愿意买车所出的价格下降了。（因为更大概率买破车）

657
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:52,060
And you have this race to the bottom in which the offer price keeps going down, down, down.
而且市场在这种恶性循环里，底价竞价中一直处于下降状态。

658
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,240
All of the good sellers leave the market
所有好的卖家都离开了市场，

659
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,300
because they are not being justly compensated for the work that they've done.
因为他们所做的工作没有得到应有的报酬。

660
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,460
What does it have to do the cryptocurrency?
这个故事对加密货币有什么启发？

661
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,780
Surveillance coins
比特币这种监控币

are the used cars of cryptocurrency.

每当您从某人那里购买比特币时，您都不知道该比特币的历史，

665
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,520
you are the used car buyer in this situation.
您是这种情况下的二手车买家。

666
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,900
You don't know if you accept this Bitcoin...

667
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:31,320
"Am I going to be just fine or am I going to be falsely accused of some who knows what?"
“这个币干净吗？还是我会被错误地指控某些犯罪？”（洗钱，毒贩，交易所被盗的币）

668
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:37,260
Who knows what possible crime could have been done with the person who used to own that Bitcoin.
谁知道与曾经拥有该比特币的人可能犯下的罪行。

669
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,240
You don't know if that's going to happen to you.
您不知道这是否会发生在您身上。

670
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:46,800

673
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,680
So in the car market, for example

674
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,180
and there's probably something similar to this in Europe,

where you can type in the serial number, the VIN number of a car

您输入汽车的序列号，就会显示所有过去的历史。（新西兰也有这种系统）

682
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:28,480
That information can equalize the playing field between the buyers and the sellers of cars.
该信息可以平衡汽车买卖双方之间的竞争环境。

683
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,600
This also happens in the job market.
在就业市场中也会发生这种情况。

684
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,320
Education is a similar situation.

All the resumes look the same after a while.
一段时间后，所有简历看起来都一样。

689
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,100
So how are the sellers of their labor going to distinguish themselves?
那么，他们的劳动力如何与众不同？

690
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,740
They're going to have a signal.
他们将发出信号。

691
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:56,600
Education is a signal just like information in the used car market is.
就像二手车市场中的信息一样，教育也是一种信号。

692
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:01,300
Basically, the sellers of labor take it upon themselves to get

693
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:06,520
educational credential to signal to the buyer of labor

that their labor is going to be worth more.

695
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,220
Unfortunately, what happens is that the sellers of education then figure this out
不幸的是，教育的卖家发现了这一点

696
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,400
and then they just start selling education

because they know that the people coming for the education are just going

698
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,900
to get an employment signal.

00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,120
The actual purpose of the education gets lost.

00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,040
This is happening in non-fungible cryptocurrencies as well.

701
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,720
Right now, anybody who signs up for an account

You have to basically submit all this stuff just to be deemed worthy enough
您必须基本上提交所有这些东西才被认为足够有价值

707
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,360
to participate in this cryptocurrency economy.
参与这种加密货币交易。

708
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,320
That is a signal in this sense too.
从这个意义上讲，这也是一个信号。

709
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,300
But what's interesting is that in cryptocurrency,

710
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:06,720
currently, the exchanges bear the burden of due diligence on their customers.
目前，交易所对客户承担尽职调查的负担。

711
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,480
It's an expense for the exchanges to be doing, to check all these people out.
交易所要检查所有这些人是一项费用。

712
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,080
It could be that in the future that just like in the education market and in the car market.
将来可能就像在教育市场和汽车市场一样。

714
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:25,460
basically to prove their worthiness in this whole system.

Just to take a step back,

I've gone over scarcity in Bitcoin and Monero
我已经阐述了比特币和门罗币的稀缺性

And if we step back,

Then, implementations of the promising idea get tested out

827
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:08,890
then there's an audit process that we actually employ

828
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:12,270
external auditors to look at implementations of code.

829
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:16,850
Once those are clean, then we go to release.
一旦校验结束，我们便开始发表。

830
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:21,670
There's this basically pipeline of technology from science to engineering

831
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:25,210
that gets pushed out in the actual release of the Monero
不断发布新版本的门罗币

832
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:27,670
core software.

833
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:33,170
The LMDB database is another kind of interesting example of how far Monero has come.
LMDB数据库是门罗币走了多远的另一种有趣的示例。

834
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,950
In the early days of Monero,

835
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:38,330
the entire blockchain was stored in RAM
整个区块链都存储在RAM中

836
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:39,830
if you can believe that.

837
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:44,690
So, that kind of puts a hard limit on how big your blockchain can be

838
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,430
if it has to fit in RAM.

if you look at the... if you rank the coins not by market cap but by actual developer effort.
如果您看……如果您不是根据市值而是根据实际开发人员的努力对硬币进行排名。

00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:14,750
It goes Bitcoin, Ethereum and then Monero.
先是比特币，以太坊，然后是门罗币。

845
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,710
It turns out that,
坦率地说，

846
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,150
well, in my opinion,
在我看来，

847
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:21,610
the killer app of Nakamoto consensus is money
中本聪共识的杀手级应用是金钱，

848
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:27,070
because you have a ledger of scarcity that's being shared.

849
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:30,490
And what's a more natural thing is there for

850
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:34,070
a shared idea of scarcity, then money?

851
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:37,690
But it turns out that money is non-trivial to get right.
但是事实证明，赚钱是不容易的。

852
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,510
It needs to be thought through.

00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:44,550
These things like... should the money have a complete history behind it

854

or should it be fungible?

855
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:49,390
Like that kind of basic idea that

basic engineering design decision has to be made early on
基本工程设计决策必须尽早做出，

And the way that the social contract is,

861
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:12,170
I just can't see this happening in Bitcoin.

862

There are volunteer workgroups for community outreach

863
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:17,150
and, as I said before,

But if you look at the annual budget

00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:41,290
if Monero were a company, which it's not --

871
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:44,850
but if Monero were a company and you looked at its operating budget,
但是如果Monero是一家公司，而您查看了其运营预算，

872
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:49,430
you would be astounded at how minuscule, how tiny it is.
您会惊讶于它多么的微小，瞄小。

873
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:52,690
And that's because you have idealistic, passionate people

Monero is what Bitcoin newbs think they bought.

I'm going to switch hats a little bit.

880
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:19,970
As I mentioned, one of my jobs before going full time in crypto

881
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,370
I was head of research at a hedge fund

And of course because there have been these spectacular gains in the price of Bitcoin,

884
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:34,110
it gets discussed a lot.

885
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:39,150
One thing that is positive about Monero's culture is that it is generally

886
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:42,530
gauche to talk about prices,
不讨论价格，

887
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:46,610
and returns, and the price going to the moon.

I have some background in academic finance;

and that, coupled with the Nobel Prize that I just explained --

893
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:12,090
hopefully, I can put a respectable enough academic sheen on the discussion of
希望我可以在门罗币价值讨论方面给予足够可观的学术知识

894
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:18,790
the finance and economics to be forgivable by the Monero community.
门罗币社区可能忽略了金融和经济学层面。

895
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:22,490
But the fact is that this project is going to attract investors,

it's going to attract hodlers.

00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:29,230
There are lots of investment, there are lots of ETFs out there.

899
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:33,630

00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,890
If, for example, like say Islamic finance --

907
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:03,050
they are not cool with the idea of interest being paid on loans,
他们对借贷支付利息的想法不满意，

908

so you have another subset of Islamic finance investments

909
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:10,550
that don't involve paying interest on loans.

for people who have two characteristics.

on the part of central banks managing Fiat

in which everything about all of us is recorded all the time

and will stay forever,

00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:45,490
and we have little or no control over that.

918
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,090
It's done in the name of security
以安全的名义监视

919
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:52,090
but unfortunately, if you push that line too far,

920
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:55,430
you cease to become an open and free society.
我们将不再成为一个开放和自由的社会。

921
00:54:55,430 --> 00:55:02,410
There are reasons that we, in the West, have put limits on the powers of government
在西方，我们有理由限制政府的权力

922
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:08,890
and that is because of an awareness of what happens when there are no limits on the powers of government.
这是因为人们意识到当政府权力不受限制时会发生什么。

923
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,850
A project like Monero is a hedge
像门罗币这样的项目是对冲

924
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:16,370
it's basically a "put your money where your mouth is" kind of thing

925
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:20,170
for people who have strong feelings on those two points

926
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,130
it's just going to attract investors.

00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:28,810
Gresham's law is an economic concept that the best form of money gets hoarded.
格雷沙姆定律是一种经济概念，最佳货币形式。

928
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:31,050
People keep the best kind of money

929
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:34,890
and the inferior form of money, they're going to use that to spend.
以及劣等的金钱形式，他们会花掉。

930
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:38,270
But the good stuff, they're going to keep for themselves. That's Gresham's law.
但是好东西，他们会自己保留。那是格雷舍姆定律。

931
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,590
So with Monero, this tends to happen.
因此，对于门罗币，这往往会发生。

932
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:43,330
A lot of people in Monero used to be in Bitcoin,
Monero中有很多人曾经使用比特币，

00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:45,970
but now, whenever they deal with Bitcoin,

they find their heads consumed with all these worries about traceability

and so on.

00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:57,210
It's refreshing to come to Monero
但来到Monero世界之后令人耳目一新

937
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:58,470
where you don't have to worry about that
在这里你不必担心（可追溯性）

938
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:00,570
because the currency is actually fungible.
因为货币实际上是可互换的。

939
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:03,790
And because it's fungible, it becomes a superior form of money
而且由于它是可互换的，因此成为一种优越的货币形式

940
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:06,170
that gets hoarded by Gresham's law.
遵循格雷沙姆的法法则。

941
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:11,190
That's another tendency that's going to happen to people: to want to keep the Monero
这是人们将会发生的另一种趋势：想保留门罗币

942
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:13,370
and spend the other stuff.
并花掉其他东西。

943
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,370
Also, capital gains taxes:
另外，资本利得税：

944
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,930
at least in America, and I believe in Germany too,
至少在美国，我也相信在德国，

945
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:22,230
if you hold an asset for over a year in Germany, you don't have to pay gains on it.
如果您在德国持有资产超过一年，则不必为此付出收益。

946
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:25,070
That's what I've read. Is that right in Germany? (nods)
这就是我读过的。在德国是这样吗？ （点头）

947
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,390
Basically, the tax law
税法根本上就会

948
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:32,930
promotes looking at those cryptocurrency projects that are solid
促进那些扎实的加密货币项目

949
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,890
and have a real reason to exist
并让加密货币有真实的理由存在

950
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:39,310
and so that is also going to attract investment money to Monero.
因此这也将吸引投资资金到Monero。

951
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:45,330
The question is: can these new investors integrate into the community?
问题是：这些新投资者可以融入社区吗？

952
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,590
Part of what I do as a consultant is I try to bridge these worlds.
作为顾问，我要做的部分工作就是尝试弥合这些世界。

953
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:52,290
I try to take these new investors
我试图吸引这些新投资者

954
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:57,450
whose inclination might be to want to talk to the "manager of Monero"

955
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:00,450
and have a word with them about the release schedule.
并与他们谈谈发布时间表。

"I own some tokens therefore I'm your customer and you have to do what I say"
“我拥有一些代币，因此我是您的客户，您必须按我说的做”

960
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:15,690
which of course falls completely flat on its face in any open-source project
当然，在任何开源项目中，那些人都会失望

961
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:18,790
as that's not how changes happen in Linux.
因为这不是Linux中更改发生的方式。

962
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:21,270
Nobody goes to Linux and demands,
没有人会向Linux系统提要求，

963
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:25,950
makes ultimatums on what they want to see in the next rollout.
对他们想在下一次发布中看到的内容下最后通碟。

964
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,610
Basically, one thing that I'm doing is

trying to bridge these worlds of the traditional investment world

966

and that of the OG, cryptocurrency open-source world

967
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:37,590
that's surrounding us here.
OG（加密货币开源世界）

968
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,910
Community investors,

969
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:42,070
I posit are kind of a subset of investors that
我认为有些投资者

970
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:46,670
can be valued members of the community. Instead of being
可以成为社区的重要成员。而不是

971
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,830
entitled and thinking that they're customers,
被称作客户，

972
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:52,370
they'll take the attitude that they're helping to bear financial risk
他们会以帮助承担财务风险的态度

973
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:54,270
on behalf of the project.

974
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:58,410
They will do things like take self-custody of their coins
他们会做一些事情，例如自己保管自己的币

975
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:01,850
and not just leave them on exchange - which lots of people do.
而不仅仅是让他们把币放交易所-很多人都这样做。

976
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:04,590
Lots of people leave their crypto on exchanges
很多人在交易所留下他们的加密货币

977
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:07,130
then the exchange gets hacked, they lose their money.
然后交易所被黑客入侵，他们失去了钱。

978
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:09,770
The reality is: if the money is on the exchange,
现实是：如果钱在交易所，

979
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:12,070
you don't own the private key and it's not your crypto.
您不拥有私钥，也不是您的加密货币。

980
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:14,570
It's actually an IOU that you own for crypto,
实际上，您拥有加密货币的借条，

981
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:16,990
it's not crypto that you own

982
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:24,230

there are proper legal structures around one's ownership of cryptocurrency.
围绕一个人的加密货币所有权有适当的法律结构。

986
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:49,610
One of the subsets of the traditional finance world that I help to bridge with cryptocurrencies is that of trusts.
我帮助与加密货币建立联系的传统金融世界的子集之一是信任。

987
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:53,210
In a statutory law kind of regime like Germany,
在像德国这样的成文法制下，

988
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:55,470
the whole concept of trust might be a little foreign
整个信任的概念可能有点陌生

989
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:57,630
because it comes from English common law.
因为它来自英国普通法。

990
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:01,530
But the idea is that a trust is a legal entity,
但想法是，信托是法人实体，

991
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:02,510
it's a legal thing.
这是合法的事情。

992
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,070
It's kind of a company
这是一家公司

993
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:07,650
but it's a different category of legal structure.
但这是法律结构的另一类。

994
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:10,050
A trust is a
信任是一种

995
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:13,830
kind of a holding vessel for funds that
是一种存放资金的船只

996
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:19,030
a giver wants to give to beneficiaries but not immediately.
捐献者希望捐献给受益人，但不是马上就捐。

997
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,010
Basically, there are three people involved.
基本上有三个人参与。

998
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:25,450
There's a grantor who has wealth and wants to transfer it to the beneficiaries

但他们不是直接捐，他们希望这笔钱能用于信托。

1000

The grantor will work to make the rules of the trust

1001
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:35,810
and then transfer property into the trust

1002
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:38,310
as part of the document that defines the trust,
作为定义信任的文档的一部分，

1003
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:42,590
you have a list of beneficiaries who could ultimately benefit from the property
您有最终受益人的财产清单

1004
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:45,330
and then you have a third party which is the trustee.
然后您有一个第三方，即受托人。

1005
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:49,570
The trustee is the legal owner of the assets that are given into trust
受托人是信托资产的合法所有者

1006
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:52,850
but the legal owner is with conditions.

1007
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:55,670
The legal owner cannot do whatever they want with the property,

1008
00:59:55,670 --> 01:00:00,250
they have to follow the instructions that are in the trust document.
他们必须遵循信任文档中的说明。

1009
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:05,670
In effect, this is what crypto people would think of as a smart contract.
实际上，这就是加密人们认为的智能合约。

1010
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:09,910
It's kind of the original old-school legal contract
这是原始的旧式法律合同

1011
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:15,230
and if you're careful with
如果您小心应对

1012
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:19,410
which jurisdictions you place the various players in the trust,
您将各个参与者置于哪个司法管辖区，

1013
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:22,650
there are advantages that can be had --
有很多优点-

1014
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:25,470
which are very dependent on jurisdiction,
非常依赖司法管辖权

1015
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:29,490
and it's just completely impossible for me to spell it out
对我来说，完全不可能讲清楚

1016
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:31,250
because of the complexity of this --
由于这很复杂-

1017
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:35,850
but possible benefits are legal tax reduction,
但可能的好处是合法减税，

1018
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:37,930
protection from being sued.
保护免受起诉。

1019
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:41,490
In other words, if money is in a trust,
换句话说，如果钱是信托的，

1020
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:45,010
it's not the giver's money anymore,
不再是施主的钱了

1021
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:48,110
it's not the wealth owner's money anymore, it's the trus't money.
它不再是财富所有者的钱，是信托的钱了

1022
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:51,970
If somebody sues the wealth owner, the wealth is gone.
如果有人起诉财富所有者，财富就不复存在了。

1023
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:54,430
It's not theirs anymore, it belongs the trust.
不再是他们的了，它属于信托。

1024
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:59,430
And then there are trust laws that protect that money from lawsuits as well.
然后，还有信托法也保护这笔钱不受诉讼。

1025
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:03,350
Most people think "well, you know, I'm at low risk.
大多数人认为“好吧，我的风险很低。

1026
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:07,370
I'm a nice guy I don't hurt anybody, nobody's going to sue me".
我是一个好人，我不会伤害任何人，没有人会起诉我。”

1027
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:11,370
But one glaring exception to this is divorce.
但是一个明显例外是离婚。

1028
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:18,550
People routinely get robbed by people who they only recently married
人们通常会被刚结婚的人抢劫

1029
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:22,870
and it turns out that irrevocable trusts made before marriage --
事实证明，不可撤销信托（ILIT)-

1030
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:25,330
you have to do it before or otherwise it won't count --
必须在结婚前先执行此操作，否则它将不起作用-

1031
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:31,350
but it's one of the only things that can survive a challenge.
但这是唯一可以经受住挑战的事物之一。

1032
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,330
Also, legal enhanced privacy
此外，法律增强了隐私

1033
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:37,470
so depending on the jurisdiction in which you place the trust,
因此，根据您放置信托的司法管辖区，

1034
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:43,690
you could benefit from enhanced privacy protecting those assets.
您可以从保护这些资产的增强的隐私权中受益。

1035
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:47,030
Actually, relevant to people who are not Americans,
实际上，与不是美国人的人有关，

1036
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:49,490
you may or may not be aware of this,
您可能知道，也可能不知道，

1037
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:54,270
but there's a saying within estate planning and wealth management

1038
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:57,150
that "America is the new Switzerland."

1039
01:01:57,350 --> 01:02:02,170
And this is because America has laws that are asymmetric.
这是因为美国的法律不对称。

1040
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:06,110
America has a law called FATCA, which was put in by Obama,
美国有一项称为FATCA的法律，该法律是由奥巴马制定的，

1041
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:14,250
which requires worldwide financial institutions to send data on Americans back to the IRS.
这要求全球金融机构将有关美国人的数据发送回国税局。

1042
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:18,090
This is why it's almost impossible for an American to get a German bank account
这就是为什么美国人几乎不可能获得德国银行帐户的原因

1043
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:20,930
because the German bank account

1044
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:24,810
will have a whole bunch of burdensome reporting requirements

01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:28,530
to the IRS to take on this American customer.

1046
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,590
That's why Americans have a lot of trouble
这就是为什么美国人有很多麻烦

1047
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:34,250
when they go overseas to work.
在他们出国工作时。

1048
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:39,050
In reaction to this, the other countries of the world came up with what's called CRS
为此，世界其他国家提出了CRS

1049
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:41,210
which is the "Common Reporting Standard."
这就是“通用报告标准”。

1050
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:44,970
The idea is the same, for example:
想法是相同的，例如：

1051
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:48,090
one European government wants to make sure that

1052
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:52,330
its citizens are not trying to hide money in Australia,
它的公民没有试图在澳大利亚藏钱，

1053
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:55,770
so they sign this like agreement

1054
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:59,330
for all these countries to share financial information with each other

1055
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:02,650
to make sure that nobody's cheating on their taxes.

1056
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:06,510
There's basically a bunch of countries that have signed on to this CRS
基本上有很多国家已经签署了此CRS

1057
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:09,350
but America is not one of them.
但是美国不是其中之一。

1058
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,690
Thus lies the asymmetry
因此存在不对称

1059
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:18,310
that for US citizens who doing affairs abroad,
对于在国外做事的美国公民来说，

1060
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:20,310
like legitimate businesses abroad,
像国外的合法企业一样

1061
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:23,150
all of that information gets sent back to the IRS.
所有这些信息都被发送回国税局。

1062
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:28,710
But for a non-US person who sets up financial affairs in the US,
但是对于在美国从事金融事务的非美国籍人士，

1063
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:33,470
there is no obligation for the US to send the information back to the home country.
美国没有义务将信息发送回本国。

1064
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:37,620
So, thus the saying, "America is the new Switzerland."
因此，俗话说“美国是新的瑞士”。

1065
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:51,090
The two small dippers vibrate on the surface of the water.
两个小号北斗在水表面振动。

1066
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:54,060
Each dipper produces its own pulse

1067
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:58,120
and the two sets of patterns overlap.

1068
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,480
Now the dippers are put out of step.

1073
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,600
This is kind of a complicated one but
这有点复杂，但是

1074
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:32,280
this is showing the degree to which the monthly ups and downs of Monero

1075
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,180
versus the monthly ups and downs of Bitcoin

For example, this square here

1079
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,400
is showing the intersection of Monero and Bitcoin.
显示了门罗币和比特币的交集。

On this axis you see the Monero return,

on this axis you see the Bitcoin return.

01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:16,220
This particular month, Monero basically quadrupled in one month.
在这个特定月份，门罗币基本上在一个月内翻了两番。

1087
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,200
This is part of owning crypto --

1088
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,660
that you're on this really wild rollercoaster ride --

and you need to kind of be able to deal with that.

there is a correlation between the returns of Monero and Bitcoin.

1096
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,480
In Modern Portfolio Theory --
在现代投资组合理论中-

1097
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,380
and this is true for also your own personal portfolio, it's an idea to think about --

1098
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:51,520
if you have two assets who you expect to do well in the future
如果您有两项资产，希望将来会做得更好

1099
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,680
and they're uncorrelated, in other words,
它们是不相关的，换句话说，

1100
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:00,380
when one asset goes up the other is flat or maybe the other one goes down,
当一项资产上升而另一项资产持平或另一项下降时，

1101
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:05,780
in other words, the ups and downs from day to day of these two different assets
换句话说，这两种不同资产的日常起伏

1102
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:07,900
tend to cancel each other out.
倾向于互相抵消。

1103
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,780
If you have that situation
如果你有这种情况

1104
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:13,440
then if you make a portfolio out of both of those assets
然后，如果您同时使用这两种资产制作投资组合

1105
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,160
your combined volatility is going to be improved.
您的综合波动率将得到改善。

1106
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,780
It's going to be reduced
它会减少

1107
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:23,860
because the components that you're adding are anti-correlated.
因为您要添加的组件是反相关的。

1108
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,980
This is a very big deal for Wall Street investors
对于华尔街投资者而言，这是一笔非常大的交易

1109
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:33,800
because it turns out correlation structure tends to be more dependable and long-lived
因为事实证明相关结构趋向于更可靠且寿命更长

1110
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,320
than predictions of outperformance, so
比预期的好，所以

1111
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,980
correlation structures tend to persist.
相关结构倾向于持续存在。

1112
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:43,600
Wall Street is always looking for sources of uncorrelated alpha.
华尔街一直在寻找不相关阿尔法的来源。

1113
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:51,280
For example, if you look at the correlation of Monero with traditional assets like US stocks, we have 0,01.
例如，如果您查看门罗币与美国资产等传统资产的相关性，则为0,01。

1114
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,100
An idea to think about is that
要考虑的一个想法是

1115
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:59,420
putting together assets that wiggle in different ways can be
将以不同方式摆动的资产放在一起

1116
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:02,260
a positive force for your overall portfolio.
为您的整体投资组合带来积极影响。

1117
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:05,540
Now again, as I mentioned, this is only talking about correlation structure.
再次，正如我提到的，这只是在谈论相关结构。

1118
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:08,880
This is like the ups and downs. This is not talking about
这就像跌宕起伏。这不是在谈论

1119
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,860
"is the price going to go up in the future."
“未来价格会上涨吗？”

1120
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,700
That's a different question.
那是一个不同的问题。

1121
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,580
Let me show this and then I'll finish.
让我展示一下，然后结束演讲。

1122
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:23,500
I'm sorry, I'm going over -- but I guess there's no one after me --
抱歉，我快讲完了-但我想我后面没有其他发言人了-

1123
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,840
but I'll try to make it quick.
但我会尽力加快速度。

1124
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:32,160
I think what I'm showing here is pretty much the only asset price chart you need
我认为我在这里显示的几乎是您所需的唯一资产价格图表

1125
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,320
and that is a very long term view.
这是一个非常长期的看法。

1126
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,360
This is showing from the beginning of cryptocurrency, 2009 to 2020.
从加密货币的开始（2009年至2020年）就可以看出这一点。

1127
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,040
This is 11 years of history
这是11年的历史

1128
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:45,880
and you almost never see this in the crypto bloggers
而且您几乎从未在加密博客中看到这一点

1129
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,140
or people on YouTube blabbing about crypto.
或YouTube上热衷于加密的人们。

1130
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:51,040
They're always focused on what happened yesterday.
他们总是专注于昨天发生的事情。

1131
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:55,000
It's totally a distraction
完全分心

1132
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,420
for anyone who has a long term view.
对于任何有长期看法的人。

1133
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:03,880
So, I would suggest whenever looking at crypto as an asset, to zoom out on the horizontal scale
因此，我建议每当将加密货币视为资产时，都应缩小水平范围

1134
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,180
and also zoom out on the vertical scale.
并缩小垂直比例。

1135
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:12,200
What I'm showing here: each of these [y axis] divisions is a factor of 10.
我在这里显示的是：[y轴]除法中的每一个都是10的因数。

1136
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,640
Here we have 1 cent, 1 dollar and 10 thousand dollars.
在这里，我们有1美分，1美元和1万美元。

1137
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:24,420
This is an initial investment of one euro becoming 10 million euros, that's the scale.
这是一欧元的初期投资，即一千万欧元，即规模。

1138
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,220
And on this sort of scale,
在这种规模

1139
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:28,760
all of these ups and downs
所有这些看起来很大的

1140
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,800
which seem big, disappear.
跌宕起伏，都消失了。

1141
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,520
For example, let's look at the S&P 500,
比如，让我们看一下标准普尔500

1142
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,400
the US stock market.
美国股市。

1143
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,340
If you're involved at all in the stock market,
如果您完全涉足股票市场，

1144
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:42,660
you know that December 2019 has been a very good month.
您知道2019年12月是非常好的月份。

1145
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,160
We're talking 15% up
我们所说的15％的增长

1146
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,500
which is really big for the stock market.
这对股市来说真的是大幅增长了。

1147
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:52,900
But if you look on this scale, it's like a pixel.
但是，如果以这种比例看，它就像一个像素。

1148
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:59,480
I think this underlines the decision
我认为这突出了决定

1149
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:04,380
that anyone has when thinking about cryptocurrency as a possible investment.
任何人在将加密货币视为一种可能的投资时都会想到的。

1150
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:07,620
It's this baby. It's still a baby.
它还是个孩子

1151
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:11,640
It's amazing because it's gone up orders of magnitude
这很神奇了，因为它上升了几个数量级

1152
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:16,020
and yet compared to other assets, it's still a baby.
可与其他资产相比，它仍然是婴儿。

1153
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,700
This next chart shows that.
下一张图表显示了这一点。

1154
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,680
What I've done here is --
我在这里所做的是-

1155
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:26,420
it's hard to understand if somebody tells you that the price of Bitcoin is $7,000.
如果有人告诉您比特币的价格是7,000美元，就很难理解。

1156
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:31,600
It's hard to know whether that's high or low. Who knows?
很难知道这是高还是低。谁知道？

1157
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:36,700
It's just really hard to know
真的很难知道

1158
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,060
because it's just one Bitcoin
因为那只是一个比特币

1159
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:41,060
and it's hard to put that in perspective.
而且很难将其视为正确的观点。

1160
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,060
What I've done here is I've taken the
我在这里所做的是

1161
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,280
value of all of the Bitcoin in existence.
把存在的所有比特币的价值拿到现实中来。

1162
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:52,540
Starting from the beginning of Bitcoin, as time goes on,
从比特币的开始，随着时间的流逝，

1163
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:55,480
more Bitcoins got rewarded to miners
矿工获得了更多的比特币奖励

1164
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,820
so there have been more Bitcoins in existence
所以有更多的比特币存在

1165
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:00,380
and the price has been going up and down.
价格一直在上涨和下跌。

1166
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:03,740
I multiplied the number of Bitcoins in existence by the current price
我将现有比特币的数量乘以当前价格

1167
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:06,020
and that gives you the market cap.
给你算出市值。

1168
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:08,900
What I've done with that is I've divided that
我所做的就是我将比特币市值除以

1169
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:15,200
by the value of all of the gold, above ground, in the world.
世界上所有黄金的价值。

1170
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,780
All of the gold that has been already been dug out of the ground
所有已经被挖出的黄金

1171
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,380
and is sitting in vaults around the world
并坐落在世界各地的保险库中

1172
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,420
and owned mostly by central governments,
主要归中央政府所有的所有黄金，

1173
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:25,640
but also a good amount is in jewelry, and so on,
但是珠宝中也有很多（黄金），依此类推，

1174
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,640
and there are estimates of this.
并且对所有黄金估价。

1175
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:32,720
Basically, there are estimates for how much gold there is in the world at any given time
基本上，可以估算出在任何给定时间世界上有多少黄金

1176
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,940
so I've divided the value of all the world's Bitcoin
所以我将全球所有比特币的价值

1177
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,360
divided by the value of all the world's gold.
除以世界上所有黄金的价值。

1178
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:41,460
And I've done that for 11 years.
我已经做了11年了。

1179
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,520
What you can see here is that,
您可以在这里看到的是，

1180
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:48,800
currently, the value of all the Bitcoin in the world is about 1% of that of all the gold.
目前，世界上所有比特币的价值约为所有黄金的1％。

1181
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,040
In other words, all the gold is worth a hundred times what all the Bitcoin is worth.
换句话说，所有黄金的价值是所有比特币价值的一百倍。

1182
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,740
And if you do that for Monero --
如果您对门罗币这样做-

1183
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:59,880
and, arguably, this analogy is even more apt for Monero,
可以说，这个比喻更适合门罗币，

1184
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,940
because when you turn a bar of gold over,
因为当你把一根金条翻过来时，

1185
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:07,160
you don't see a list of everyone who owned that bar of gold,
您不会看到拥有过该金条的所有人的列表，

1186
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,400
you just see gold --
你只看到黄金-

1187
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,800
Monero acts more like actual gold than Bitcoin does,
门罗币比比特币更像实际的黄金，

1188
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,760
therefore, it makes more sense to make a ratio of all the world's Monero,
因此，更合理地设定全世界所有门罗币的比例，

1189
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:16,940
how much is that worth --
那值多少钱-

1190
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:19,520
divided by how much all the world's gold is worth
除以世界上所有黄金的价值

1191
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:24,920
if you do that, we're looking at 1/100 of 1%.
如果您这样做，我们结论是1％的1/100。

1192
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:32,200
That's what I mean when I say that this asset class is still a baby, it's still early.
这就是我说这个资产类别仍然是婴儿时，还是太早了。

1193
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,480
Things could go well for it, things could go very wrong for it.
事情可能会顺利进行，事情可能会出错。

1194
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:39,060
There could be a bug that nobody knows about.
可能存在一个没人知道的错误。

1195
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:41,960
There could be governmental action which a lot of people
可能会有很多人担心的，政府干预

1196
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,320
I think overly worry about
我觉得过分担心了

1197
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:49,460
because I think we geeks tend to think of governments as being like Reddit moderators
因为我认为我们的天才们倾向于认为政府就像Reddit主持人一样

1198
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:51,320
with ban power.
具有禁令的权力。

1199
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,380
And that's not really how governments work,
这并不是政府的运作方式，

1200
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,380
it's a bit more deliberative --
（政府）是经过深思熟虑的-

1201
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:59,380
and if an unjust ban happens, there are things like the Supreme Court
如果发生不公正的禁令，诸如最高法院

1202
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:03,460
that might be asked to decide whether, for example,
可能会被要求决定是否（禁止）例如

1203
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:09,120
Americans have a fundamental right to transact value in a private manner.
美国人享有私下交易价值的基本权利。

1204
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,900
This could be a court case that comes up in the future
这可能是将来人们

1205
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,560
put forth by people
要提起的诉讼

1206
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:19,460
who really care about privacy as a fundamental human right.
谁真正关心隐私是一项基本人权。

1207
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:23,290
I'll leave with that, and thanks for your attention.
我将离开（我把话撂在这），并感谢您的关注。
